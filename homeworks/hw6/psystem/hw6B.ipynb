    "This is part of Homework 6.  Due by 11:00pm on March 10, 2023\n",

    "## Solving the p-system with Clawpack\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point of this assignment is to get some more experience running Clawpack and producing plots.  There is not much that you have to do for this part of the homework, just run the code provided with 4 sets of initial data corresponding the Riemann problem data from Question 1 of the notebook `hw6A.ipynb`.  This should help you check your solutions found there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows one approach to using Clawpack via a Jupyter notebook, and shows the solution for two of the four sets of data.  You could simply augment this notebook with two more cells to compute and display the results for the other two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can run clawpack at the command line as explained earlier and as you probably did for hw3.  In that case you will want to modify the Riemann data that is specified in `setrun.py`, run the code, make the plots, and save an appropriate frame of the solution to illustrate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to try doing it both ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you do not need to turn much in for this problem, produce the required plots to show that you got it working.  Also please spend some time studying the code to understand how things work and ask questions if you don't.  I hope that this will help you see how you might use Clawpack in the future for other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note as you inspect the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Fortran 90 module `setprob_module.f90` creates some variables for parameters that can be used in other parts of the code and also defines the function `p(v)` needed for the p-system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The subroutine `setprob.f90` reads in the problem-specific parameters need for this particular problem.  Note how these variables are specified in `setrun.py`.  When you do `make .data` these get written out to `setprob.data`, which is subsequently read in by the Fortran code when you `make .output`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The subroutine `qinit.f90` sets the initial conditions base on the left and right state specified in `setrun.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The subroutine `rp1_psystem_roe.f90` implements the Roe solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code is set up to solve the problem on a very fine grid with 1000 cells, so that the computed solution should be a very good approximation to the true Riemann solution.  Note that this is true even though the Roe solver is used to solve each Riemann problem at every cell interface each time step.  The Roe solver may give a poor approximation to the true Riemann solution in the very first time step, when resolving the initial jump, but the numerical method is consistent with the true flux and so after hundreds of time steps on a fine grid the solution looks quite good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `setplot.py` function prints out the value from the grid cell near $x=0$ at each time so you can see how well this approximates the true state $q_m$ from the Riemann problem being solved (and use it to check your solutions to `hw6A`)."
