Midterm
-------

There will be an in-class :ref:`midterm` exam on February 15, 2023.

insure that you are proficient with some of the theory and algorithms
presented in the course.

Homework format
---------------

Written solutions should be submitted as pdf files (not Word, please).
Ideally these should be typeset using latex.  
(See :ref:`biblio_latex` for some sources).  
If necessary you can hand write
and scan, but typeset work is much easier to grade and is good practice.

If you use a notebook, please submit both the `.ipynb` file and the
`.html` or `.pdf` file that is generated via the `Files --> Download as...` 
menu, or with the `ipython nbconvert` command.  If you use
a Python script, please submit the `.py` file.

For computer code, please include suitable documentation to describe
what you've done and also explain it in your written solutions when
appropriate.  Include appropriate figures in your writeup.
