There will be 6 homework assignments during the quarter, requiring a
combination of analytical and programming work.
See :ref:`hwformat` below for information on the desired format.

There will also be an open-book midterm exam late in the quarter, covering
some theoretical aspects of the material.

Midterm

There will be a midterm exam, tentatively scheduled for February 15.  
The exam will be open book, open notes.  The goal will be to
insure that you are proficient with some of the theory and algorithms
presented in the course.

Homework format
---------------

Written solutions should be submitted as pdf files (not Word, please).
Ideally these should be typeset using latex.  
(See :ref:`biblio_latex` for some sources).  
If necessary you can hand write
and scan, but typeset work is much easier to grade and is good practice.

You can write analytical solutions in an
Jupyter notebook if you wish to, which makes it
particularly easy to mix analysis with code illustrations.
If you do so, submit both the `.ipynb` file and also the `pdf` generated by
`nbconvert`.

For computer code, please include suitable documentation to describe
what you've done and also explain it in your written solutions when appropriate.
