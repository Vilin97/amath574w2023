notebooks developed for this class.  You should be able to run them on your
computer if you have Jupyter installed (see `jupyter.org
<http://jupyter.org/>`_), after starting the jupyter server
using this command from the bash shell::

    $ jupyter notebook

and then navigate to the page indicated with a browser, e.g. running the
command above might produce this message::

    The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
