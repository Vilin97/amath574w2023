Homework 2
=============================================================

- `hw2.pdf <_static/hw2.pdf>`_

The homework is due by 11:00pm PDT on January 26, 2023.  You can turn it in
up to 24 hours late with a 10% reduction in credit.  

Note that the final programming problem is not yet fully specified. I'll
update the assignment by 1/20 to give more details, and will be providing a
Jupyter notebook to get you started.

The latex file for this homework assignment is in the :ref:`class_repos` in the
directory `$AM574/homeworks/hw2`.  You are encouraged to use latex to do the
homework, in which case you might want to start with this file.  There are
some comments in the file indicating where in add your solutions.

See :ref:`hwformat` for more info on what to submit if you want to
submit Jupyter notebook(s) or other code.

Alternatively you can hand write and scan parts of it, and scan hand-drawn
figures.


To submit, see the 
`Canvas page <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1611247/assignments/7922061>`_.
