Outline and schedule
=============================================================

There is a lot of material to cover (see :ref:`info` for an overview of
topics and goals).  It will not be possible to cover everything in 
detail in lectures.  

The textbook [FVMHP] covers many details that will be omitted from lectures.  You
should read the relevant sections *before* lecture and come with any
questions you have about the material.

See the class `Canvas page <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1611247>`_
for videos to watch before lectures.  Note that many of the slides indicate
in the bottom right corner what section of the book is most relevant. The
slides can be found in the `slides` directory of the :ref:`class_repos`.

See :ref:`homeworks` for Homework schedule and assignments.
